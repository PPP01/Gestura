### v1.1 (2025-12-24)

**Fixes & Optimizations:**
- **System Compatibility**: **Fixed right-click menu conflict on Mac and Linux; changed to double-click to call out the context menu to ensure mouse gestures work**.
    > Note: Due to macOS system characteristics, when dragging text, you must select the text, hold the left button briefly, and then drag; otherwise, the search may not trigger.
- **Default Experience Optimization**:
    - **Re-adjusted default gesture mapping to align with Edge browser, reducing the learning curve**.
    - New tab opening position changed from "Far Right" to **Right of Current Tab**.
    - Removed smooth scrolling animation for "Scroll to Top/Bottom" to significantly improve response speed.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed issue where `localhost` domains could not be added to the blacklist.
    - Fixed issue where dragging left accidentally triggered "Create Split View," causing functionality failure.
- **Recognition Optimization**: Optimized gesture matching rules; gestures must strictly match the trajectory to respond, effectively preventing false positives.
- **Other**: Multiple detail experience optimizations.

**New Features:**
- **Global Switch**: Added a global "Enable/Disable" switch for **Mouse Gestures** (Super Drag is unaffected).
- **More Gesture Actions**: Added "Maximize/Restore Window", "Minimize Window", "Open Custom URL", "Copy Current URL", and other practical operations.
