## Gestura Changelog

> Gestura is a fork of [FlowMouse](https://github.com/Hmily-LCG/FlowMouse). The
> history below includes the upstream FlowMouse changelog; Gestura's added
> features (configurable search engines, context-aware menus, image search) are
> the entries under v2.3.

### v2.3 (2026-07-14)

**New Features:**

- **Website menus:** predefined, fully editable menus for popular sites (GitHub, YouTube, Amazon incl. country selection, …) with icons; new settings section.
- **Search & Shopping menus:** two predefined search-engine menus — "Search" (Google, Brave, Perplexity, DuckDuckGo, Bing, DeepL, Wikipedia) and "Shopping" (Brave, Google, Amazon, eBay). Searches receive the current selection.
- **Default menu:** exactly one website menu can be marked as the default (exclusive toggle; "Search" out of the box) — it opens on all sites without a matching menu and is highlighted in the list (star + bold name).
- **Link opening behavior (advanced):** menu links and searches open per a global setting — standard (left-click same tab, right/middle-click new tab) or always in a new tab (right/left/end/start) — with an optional per-menu override.
- **Quick-search bar:** optional mini menu (default: Brave, Google, Perplexity; editable) appended to the bottom of every custom menu, with a per-menu opt-out.
- **Two menu actions:** "Website menus" opens the site menus (contextual by URL as the default, or a standard menu / customized standard menu that inherits updates for unchanged items); "Custom menu" is back to being the private per-gesture menu.
- Menu items support links, searches, and any gesture action, each with a selectable icon (Lucide set or favicon).
- **Breaking:** the old shared custom-menu pool was removed; gestures using it must be reconfigured.
- **Context-aware search menus:** Custom mouse menus can now contain search-engine entries from a built-in catalog (displayed with icons) alongside custom search/link items; menus carry site patterns so the same gesture automatically opens the right menu per site (contextual mode); a new "Add current site to menu" gesture appends `*hostname*` to a menu's patterns, making it quick to assign a menu to the site you're currently visiting.
  - **Editable Search Engines section:** The options page now has a top-level "Search Engines" section where you can add, edit, hide, reorder, and reset both built-in and custom search engines.
  - **Clipboard-open mode:** A new per-engine option copies the selected text to the clipboard and opens the page without a query parameter — useful for services like Gemini that do not accept a `?q=` URL.
  - **Custom JavaScript transform for search links:** Each search-link engine can now carry an optional JS snippet that receives the current `selection` (and optionally the `clipboard`) and returns the string substituted for `%s`. The snippet runs in an isolated sandbox with no access to the page or the extension, and can be tested against a sample input directly in the editor. An optional **"Replace default encoding"** toggle inserts the transform result verbatim into the URL, skipping `%s`, `+`, and slug encoding — useful when the function already returns a fully-formed URL component.
- Search-engine selection for text drag and the clipboard-search action now uses the central search-engine catalog, so your custom engines, hidden state, and ordering apply there too. Regional search engines (Baidu, Yandex, Naver, etc.) are included but hidden by default.
- Image search engines are now configurable in the "Search engines" page (Text/Image switch) — add custom reverse-image engines, reorder, hide, and give each an optional image-URL transform (e.g. thumbnail → original).

### v1.1 (2025-12-24)

**Fixes & Optimizations:**
- **System Compatibility**: **Fixed right-click menu conflict on Mac and Linux; changed to double-click to call out the context menu to ensure mouse gestures work**.
    > Note: Due to macOS system characteristics, when dragging text, you must select the text, hold the left button briefly, and then drag; otherwise, the search may not trigger.
- **Default Experience Optimization**:
    - **Re-adjusted default gesture mapping to align with Edge browser, reducing the learning curve**.
    - New tab opening position changed from "Far Right" to **Right of Current Tab**.
    - Removed smooth scrolling animation for "Scroll to Top/Bottom" to significantly improve response speed.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed issue where `localhost` domains could not be added to the blacklist.
    - Fixed issue where dragging left accidentally triggered "Create Split View," causing functionality failure.
- **Recognition Optimization**: Optimized gesture matching rules; gestures must strictly match the trajectory to respond, effectively preventing false positives.
- **Other**: Multiple detail experience optimizations.

**New Features:**
- **Global Switch**: Added a global "Enable/Disable" switch for **Mouse Gestures** (Super Drag is unaffected).
- **More Gesture Actions**: Added "Maximize/Restore Window", "Minimize Window", "Open Custom URL", "Copy Current URL", and other practical operations.

    - **Visual Tweaks**: Supports enabling/disabling the display of the gesture trail origin point.
    - **Custom Gestures**: Supports drawing and adding custom mouse gestures (default supports 4-way combinations ↑↓←→).

        - Fully supports 4-way (↑↓←→) dragging and foreground/background opening settings for text, images, and links.
        - **Text**: Added "Copy Text".
        - **Images**: Added "Save Image", "Copy Image Address", "Custom Image Search".
        - **Links**: Added "Copy Link".
